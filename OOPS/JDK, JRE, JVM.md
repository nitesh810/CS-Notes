- JDK
    
    Java Development Kit is a software development kit that helps develop Java applications.Â It includes the JVM, compiler, debugger, and other tools.
- JRE
	
	JRE stands for "Java Runtime Environment." It is a software package that provides the runtime support for executing Java applications. The JRE includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), libraries, and other components necessary for running Java applications but does not include the development tools (compiler, debugger, etc.) that are part of the Java Development Kit (JDK).
	
- JVM
	
	JVM stands for "Java Virtual Machine." It is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. The JVM is a crucial component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK). Its primary role is to execute Java bytecode.
	**Key Features :**
	- **Platform Independence**
	- **Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT):** The JVM includes a Just-In-Time Compiler that translates Java bytecode into native machine code at runtime.
	- **Security**
	- **Memory Management:** The JVM manages memory allocation and garbage collection, handling the creation and removal of objects during program execution.
