- Simple:
    
    Java is a simple programming language to learn. It has a clean and concise syntax, which makes it easy to read and write code.
    
- Object-oriented:
    
    Java is an object-oriented programming language. This means that everything in Java is an object, which has both data and functions.
    
- Platform-independent:
    
    Java bytecode can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java code highly portable.
    
- Secure:
    
    Java has a number of security features, such as bytecode verification and sandboxing, which help to protect Java applications from malicious code.
    
- Robust:
    
    Java is a robust language, which means that it is less likely to crash than other programming languages. This is due to Java's strong typing system and garbage collection.
    
- Multithreaded:
    
    Java supports multithreading, which allows multiple tasks to run concurrently. This can improve the performance of Java applications.
    
- Interpreted:
    
    Java bytecode is interpreted by the JVM, which means that Java programs do not need to be compiled before they can run. This makes Java development faster and easier.
