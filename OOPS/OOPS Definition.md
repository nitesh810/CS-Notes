- **Object-oriented programming (OOP)** uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs.
- OOP makes it easier to create complex programs that are easier to maintain and reuse.
- OOP is based on several concepts such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

#### Benefits of using OOP in Java:

- Modularity:
    
    OOP allows you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces. This makes it easier to develop and maintain your code.
    
- Reusability:
    
    OOP allows you to reuse code across different programs. This can save you time and effort.
