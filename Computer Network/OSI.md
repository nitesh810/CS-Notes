The Open System Interconnection [OSI] model is a conceptual model developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in 1984. The OSI model provides a standard for communication between different/diverse computer systems.

The OSI model has seven layers in which each layer has a specific set of functions and communicates with the layer above and below itself.

**There are majorly 2 main layers in the OSI model:**

- Physical Layer
- Data Link Layer

**Physical Layer:** The physical layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for transmitting message bits over a medium and it also takes care of mechanical, electrical, procedural, and functional specifications for communication.

**Data Link Layer(DLL):** The data link layer breaks data packets received from the network layer into smaller pieces called frames and is responsible for the error-free transmission of these frames from one node to another using its MAC address.

### Heart of OSI model : (7 layers)
1. Physical
2. Data link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

Every functionalities of computer network is divides into all these 7 layers
Whenever Sender send's the data to Receiver. It will pass the data through these 7 layers then Receiver receives the data
