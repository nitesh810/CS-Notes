VPN stands for ==Virtual Private Network==. It's a cybersecurity tool that encrypts your internet connection and hides your location. This protects your online privacy.

**VPNs can be used for :**
- Remote access
    Employees can use a VPN to connect to a private network. For example, a remote worker can connect to their company's internet or restricted applications.
    
- Privacy
    VPNs can protect your online privacy by hiding your real IP address. This can stop your browsing data from being sold to advertisers.
