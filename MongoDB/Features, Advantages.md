#### Features 
1. *Document Oriented*
	MongoDB stores all the data in the form of documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. In these documents, the data is stored in key-value pairs instead of rows and columns which make the data much more flexible in comparison to RDBMS where each document contains a unique ID.
	
2. *Schema-less Database*
	
3. *Scalability*
	MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of a mechanism known as sharding. Sharding refers to the process of distributing data on multiple servers
	
4. *Indexing*
	
5. *High Performance*

#### Advantages of MongoDB
1. It is a schema-less NoSQL database. Therefore, we need not design the schema of the database when we are working with MongoDB.
2. It is a document-oriented database and the data is stored in BSON documents.
3. It does not support join operation.
4. It provides high performance, and scalability.
5. MongoDB has inbuilt support for data partitioning (Sharding).
