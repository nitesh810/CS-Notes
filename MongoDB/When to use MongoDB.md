You should use MongoDB when you are building business applications that need to evolve quickly and scale elegantly. MongoDB is popular with developers of all kinds who are building scalable applications using agile methodologies.

**MongoDB is a great choice if one needs to:**

- Support a rapid iterative development.
- Scale to high levels of read and write traffic - MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through Sharding, distributing data across several machines, and facilitating high throughput operations with large sets of data.
- Scale your data repository to a massive size.
- Evolve the type of deployment as the business changes.
- Store, manage and search data with text, geospatial, or time-series dimensions.
