Data Abstraction is a process of hiding unwanted or irrelevant details from the end user. It provides a different view and helps in achieving data independence which is used to enhance the security of data.

1. **View Level or External Level**
	
	View or External Level is the highest level of data abstraction. 
	This level is for the user interaction; at this level, end users can access the data based on their queries.
	
2. Logical or Conceptual Level
	
	The logical or conceptual level is the middle level of data abstraction. It explains what data is going to be stored in the database and what the relationship is between them.
	
3. Physical or Internal Level
	
	The physical or internal layer is the lowest level of data abstraction. It is the layer that defines how data is actually stored in the database. It defines methods to access the data in the database. It defines complex data structures in detail, so it is very complex to understand, which is why it is kept hidden from the end user.
