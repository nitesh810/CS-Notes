- The two-tier architecture is a client-server architecture.
- The server manages the database functionality.
- Clients use the Database through APIs over a direct internet connection.

## ****Advantages of 2-Tier Architecture****
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to modify
- Faster communication
- Cost effective

## ****Disadvantages of 2-Tier Architecture****
- Performance
    
    The application's performance decrease as the number of users increases.Â This is because the server is under more pressure as there are more users.
	
- Security
    
    It is difficult to implement reliable security as users need to have login information for every database server.
	
- Data integrity
    
    The server cannot respond to multiple requests at the same time, which can cause data integrity issues.
