It divides an application's components into three tiers or layers: **Client, Application server, Database server**.

- In a 3-tier architecture, the client does not directly communicate with the server. Instead, it interacts with the application server, which then communicates with the database system.
	
- The 3-tier architecture is used for large applications on the web. Some of its features include: Data backup, Recovery, Security, Concurrency control.

## ****Advantages of 2-Tier Architecture****
- High performance
- Improve security
- Scalability
- Better to re-use
- Balancing of load is much easier


## ****Disadvantages of 2-Tier Architecture****
- **Complexity:** Three-tier architecture is more complex than two-tier architecture.
- **Performance:** It can experience a performance drop when operated over the Internet.
