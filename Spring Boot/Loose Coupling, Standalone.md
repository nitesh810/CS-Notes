- ***Loose Coupling***
	
	- Loosely Coupled application is a design pattern. 
	- In a loosely coupled design, components are independent, and changes in one will not affect the operation of others.
	- This approach offers optimal flexibility and re-usability
	
- ***Tight Coupling***
	
	But Tight Coupling is just opposite of Loose Coupling, In a tightly coupled system, components are highly interdependent. Changes in one component can cause widespread effects.


### Standalone
A standalone Spring Boot application is an application that can run without the need for an external server. This is because Spring Boot includes an embedded Tomcat server that can be used to serve the application.

To create a standalone Spring Boot application, you can use the Spring Boot Initializer. The Initializer will create a new project with the necessary dependencies and configuration for a standalone application.
