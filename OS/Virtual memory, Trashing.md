When the computer's main memory is full, the OS uses Secondary memory as main memory.
Virtual memory allows the computer to continue running applications even when the physical RAM is insufficient to hold all the active data.

**Performance Impact:** Accessing data from secondary storage (hard disk or SSD) is slower compared to accessing data from RAM.


## Trashing
It is a situation where system spend too much time on swapping data between RAM and Secondary memory. This phenomenon occurs when the system is under memory pressure.
The excessive swapping leads to a degradation in performance and responsiveness.

***Thrashing typically occurs :***
- Insufficient Physical RAM
- High Demand for Resources
- Excessive Page Faults

## Page faults
The constant movement of data between RAM and storage results in high number of page faults (occurs when a program accesses data that is not currently in RAM).
