- ***Multi-programming***
	
	Multiprogramming involves running multiple programs simultaneously on a single processor. In a multiprogramming operating system, programs share CPU time. For example, if one program is waiting for input/output (I/O) to finish, another program can use the CPU.
	Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel.
	
- ***Multi-tasking***
	
	- Multiple application / process at once. (running parallelly)
	 - Parallelism is achieved.
	- Allows users to run multiple programs at the same time.
	- Multitasking operating systems allow multiple applications to run without affecting CPU performance.
	-  It enables users to run multiple tasks simultaneously.
	- Some examples of multitasking operating systems include : Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android etc.
	
- ***Multi-processing
	
	- Multiprocessing allows system to run multiple processors at once.
	- Multiprocessing allows multiple processes to be executed simultaneously. This increases a system's computing speed. 
	- It can refer to the use of two or more CPUs in a single computer system. 
	- It can also refer to ***Multithreading.**
	
- ***Multi-threading
	
	 - Within a single application multiple parts are being executed. like chrome, IntelliJ.
	 - Parallelism is achieved within an application.
	Multithreading is a programming concept that allows a program to run multiple threads concurrently. In multithreading, each thread runs a process. Threads can run fully parallel if they are distributed to their own CPU core.
	
	**Disadvantage :** Race condition (means fight between different thread for resources and other thread are not getting the resources and that thread dies).
	
	**Multithreading can:** 
	
	- Enable more than one user at a time
	- Handle multiple requests from the same user
