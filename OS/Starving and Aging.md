Starving/Starvation(also called Lived lock): Starvation is the problem that occurs when low priority processes get jammed for an unspecified time as the high priority processes keep executing. So starvation happens if a method is indefinitely delayed.

Solution to Starvation : Ageing is a technique of gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time.
