### Volatile memory
Volatile memory is used for temporary storage and loses its data when the power is removed.

****Volatile memory****
    - Stores data when a computer is on
    - Erases data as soon as the computer is switched off
    - The quickest kind of memory
    - Saves the most frequently used information
    - Examples include RAM and Cache memory

### Non-volatile memory
Non-volatile memory is used for permanent or long-term storage and preserves data even when the power is off.

****Non-volatile memory****
    - Retains data even when the power is turned off
    - Slower than volatile memory
    - Can access data faster than volatile memory
    - Examples include ROM (Random Access Memory) and HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
